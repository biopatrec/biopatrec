= Getting the data =

You first need to load data through the "Get Sig Features" botton. Doing this, there will be a window, which allows you to select the {{{*.mat}}} file of your interest. You can either load a previous recording session ([recSession]) or saved signal features ([sigFeatures]). If you load some other kind of data the message _That was not a valid training matrix_ will be displayed.

 * Load a recording session
 If you load data of a recording session, the program will identify that through the variable [recSession] or _ss_ (the ss structure was used in [EMG_AQ]). In case of _ss_ it will transform it into [recSession] in order to keep compatibility.
 The subfunction [Load_recSession] will be executed.

 * Load signal features
 In case you load signal features data, the program will recognize that through the variable [sigFeatures] and will execute [Load_sigFeatures].

NOTE: To do any real-time testing you must have configured your DAQ card, see [BioPatRec_StartupGuide].
