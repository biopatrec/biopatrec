#summary Discriminant Analysis Description

= Introduction =

This is the standard statistical method for pattern recognition (PatRec), where Linear Discriminant Analysis ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis LDA]) is probably the most popular and well-known. 

= Implementation =

The implementation is based on MATLAB _classify_ function. See [http://www.mathworks.se/help/toolbox/stats/classify.html Discriminant Analysis in Matlab] for details. 

All discriminant analysis types available in Matlab can also be selected from the [GUI_PatRec].

 * linear 
 * diaglinear
 * quadratic
 * diagquadratic
 * mahalanobis

Really, check out [http://www.mathworks.se/help/toolbox/stats/classify.html Discriminant Analysis] for details.

Note: It requires the Matlab's Statistics Toolbox.
