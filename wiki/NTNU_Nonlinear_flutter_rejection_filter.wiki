#summary Information about the nonlinear flutter rejection filter

NOTE: This is an ongoing development and therefore the documentation is not yet finalised.

= Nonlinear flutter rejection filter =

The purpose of this filter is to suppress fast and small-amplitude variations in the estimate of the output; thus, the estimate is smoothed and the motors of the output-device are relieved of oscillating actuations. This improves the stability of the prosthesis control, as the actuation estimates are kept constant for small variations in the estimate of the input to the motors ^[1]^.

== Details ==
For details around the filter, see the nonlinear flutter rejection filter in the figure on the [NTNU front page] of the NTNU contribution. The only thing to notice, is that the nonlinearity in the filter is defined by y = |x| tanh(k x).

The code is implemented within the function called _!NonlinearFlutterRejectionFilter_, and is located inside the proportional control folder.
