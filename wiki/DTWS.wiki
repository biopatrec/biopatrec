 * 16 EMG channels.
 * 48 acceleromter channels.
 * 64 channels real-time analog output.
 * Full USB support
 * All sensor are Wireless
 * All sensors has 16 bit signal resoltion at 2000Hz.

At [NTNU] this system is used with USB. For this setup to work a SDK that is provided with the complete system has to be used in order to access the data stream from the sensor system.
