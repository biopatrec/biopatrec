#summary Technical requirements to run BioPatRec

= Requirements =

 * Matlab R2011b
  * Data Acquisition Toolbox (recordings)
  * Statistics Toolbox ([LDA])

BioPatRec was initially developed in Matlab `R2009`, however the latest version was only tested in `R2011b`. Some parts of BioPatRec might work in previous versions, but the VRE and the data acquisition routines need `R2011b`.

== Data Acquisition ==

The DAQ routines currently work with the Matlab "session-based interface (SBI)". The "legacy" routines can be made available under request.

We have used the simplest National Instruments card (USB-6009) for most of our experiments. We expect any NI card to work seemly, however you wonâ€™t know until you try it. In theory, the SBI should allow you to USB a wide variety of DAQ cards.

If you are planning to use the USB-6009 card you will need the drivers [http://joule.ni.com/nidu/cds/view/p/id/2604/lang/en NI-DAQmx]

Note: Other devices using SCI have been used as well. These routines and the "legacy" routines for MATLAB can be made available upon request.
