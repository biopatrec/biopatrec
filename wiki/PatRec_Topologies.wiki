#summary Description of the different classifier's topologies

= Introduction =

The BioPatRec allows you to create seemsly differet classifiers topologies using the available PatRec algorithms.

The topologies are created as part of OfflinePatRec, and later call in OneShotPatRecClassifier. Each topology uses a specific evaluation function named: 

 * {{{PatRec_TopologyName}}}

All evaluation functions return two variables: 

 * ''outMov'' is a vector with the predicted movements indices.

 * ''outVector'' is a vector with the classifier certanty of each movement, not only the predicted ones.

= Topologies =

== Single Classifier ==
({{{PatRec_SingleClassifier}}})

 A single classifier is created.

== Ago-antagonist ==
({{{PatRec_AgoAntagonist}}})

 This topology has as many classifiers as DoF, or Classes/2. Therefore it is assumed that consecutive classes are Ago-Antagonist movements organized in pairs per DoF. The rest movements is considered as an exeption.

 The classifier is trained only using the Ago-Antagonist data sets.

 The output is given by the winner per DoF. 
 NOTE: Not working! It will always predict as many movements as DoF as it is. It needs to be modified.

== Ago-antagonist & Mixed ==
({{{PatRec_AgoAntagonistRest}}})

 Same than Ago-antagonist but the classifier is trained using the Ago-Antagonist sets plus a set mixed with the remaning classes.

 The output is given by the winner per DoF.

== One-vs-All ==
({{{PatRec_OneVsAll}}})
 
 This topology has as many classifiers as classes. A single classifier is trained to distinguish between a given class and the rest of the classes. The data sets used to form the rest class is made with the same contribution per remaining class.

 The output of each classifier is assigned to the corresponding movement.

== One-vs-All Threshold ==
({{{PatRec_OneVsAllT}}})
 
 This topology has as many classifiers as classes. A single classifier is trained to distinguish between a given class and the rest of the classes. The data sets used to form the rest class is made with the same contribution per remaining class.

 The output of each classifier is assigned to the corresponding movement.

== One-vs-One ==
({{{PatRec_OneVsOne}}})

 This topology has as {{{n*(n-1)/2}}} classifiers (n=classes). 

 The output is normally given by major voting which makes it not suitable for simultaneous classification. However, in this specific application we considered a correct prediction if the probability of prediction is higher than 85%. 

== One-vs-One DoF ==
({{{PatRec_OneVsOneDoF}}})

 Same than before but the lossing movements in the DoF is made zero.
 NOTE: Needs to be worked more

= Auxilary routines =

 *[ExtractSets_Stack

 This function extract the corresponding set of selected movements. It keeps the format of [xSets] and xOuts but only with the rows corresponding to the selected movements (selSets)

 *[ExtractSets_Stack_MixRest

 It differes from [ExtractSets_Stack] by also including a mix of the remaining movements in a set with a single output.
 It get sets orderly one per set until the data set is completed with the remaining sets. 

 *[ExtractSets_Stack_MixRestEqual

 It differes from [ExtractSets_Stack_MixRest] by creating an equal number of sample between the selected sets and the mixed sets.

== How to add a new Topology ==

The following must be done to add "newTopology"

 * Add the name of the topology in the [GUI_PatRec] pop menu [pm_SelectTopology], e.g. {{{newTopology}}}
 * Specify how this topology is created in OfflinePatRec
 * Make the case in OneShotPatRecClassifier
 * Create file {{{PatRec_newTopology}}} inside !PatRec/Topologies where the output of this topology will be compute.
