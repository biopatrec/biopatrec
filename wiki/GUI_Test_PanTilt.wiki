The GUI GUI_Test_Pan_Tilt was created to test the motors of the i-limb and manually change the pulse width modulation (PWM) for a given time for Pronation, Supination, Flex and Extend movements.

The GUI consists of 6  main parts:

Initiate the serial connection.
There are 3 buttons (Connect, Disconnect, Test connection) which handles the communication (for detailed information see [[Test_PWMs]]).

 * Connect: Calls "Connect_ALC" which returns the communication object saved in the handles as "com". The "com" object is necessary for all future communication. It also test the connection by calling "TestConnectionALC". This function writes a 'C' and expects a 1 in return if the communication is successful.

 * Disconnect: Close the 'com' object.

 * Pronate & Supinate: This is facilitated by the duty cycle of the PWM and the movement of the motor is proportional to the duty cycle from minimum to maximum.

 * Flex & Extend: This is facilitated by the duty cycle of the PWM and the movement of the motor is proportional to the duty cycle from minimum to maximum from other servo motor.

 * Step: Decides the angular displacement of the motor(in terms of duty cycle)

 * Center: Gets the servo motor position to the center of its maximum allowed angular displacement.
