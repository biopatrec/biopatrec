#summary Description of GUI_Test_PanTilt

== GUI_Test_Pan_Tilt ==

The GUI GUI_Test_Pan_Tilt was created to test the motors of the Pan, Tilt and manually change the pulse width modulation (PWM) for a given time for Pronation, Supination, Flex and Extend movements.

The GUI consists of 2 main parts:

== Initialize the serial connection == 
 There are 3 buttons (''Connect, Disconnect, Test connection'') which handles the communication 
 * Connect: Calls "Connect_ALC" which returns the communication object saved in the  handles as "com". The "com" object is necessary for all future   communication.
 * Test Connection: Calls "TestConnectionALC" which writes a 'C' and expects a 1 in return if the communication is successful.
 * Disconnect:  Close the 'com' object.


== Control ==

 * Pronate & Supinate: This is facilitated by the duty cycle of the PWM and the movement of the motor is proportional to the duty cycle from minimum to maximum.

 * Flex & Extend: This is facilitated by the duty cycle of the PWM and the movement of the motor is proportional to the duty cycle from minimum to maximum from other servo motor.

 * Step: Decides the angular displacement of the motor(in terms of duty cycle)

 * Center: Gets the servo motor position to the center of its maximum allowed angular displacement.
