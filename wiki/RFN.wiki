#summary RFN implementation

= Introduction =

Regulation Feedback Networks were initially introduced by [http://reason.cs.uiuc.edu/tsvi/ Tsvi Achler] as an alternative to the traditional "feed forward" or "lateral inhibition" pattern recognition algorithms. 

In traditional pattern recognition, the learning takes places during a training phase, in RFN, the pattern recognition occurs during the testing phase by observing the stability of the outputs.

Feedback regulation is analogous to the negative feedback in control theory.
