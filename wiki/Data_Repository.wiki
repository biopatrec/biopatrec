#summary Data Repository

This folder contains a repository of myoelectric recording sessions ([recSession]) useful for development, as well as for algorithms benchmarking on common data sets.

== 10mov4chUntargetedForearm ==
  * 10 hand and wrist motions
  * 3 seconds contraction time with 3 seconds for relaxation between each repetition
  * 3 repetitions of each motion
  * 4 bipolar electrodes (Disposable Ag/AgCl)
  * 1 cm electrode diameter
  * 2 cm inter-electrode distance for the bipole
  * Electrodes were equally spaced around the most proximal third of the forearm.
  * The first channel was always placed along the extensor carpi ulnaris
  * The proximal electrode of each bipole was always connected to the positive terminal of the BioAmp.
  * 17 subjects (original study)
  * 20 subjects (final release)
  * BioAmp:
   * In-house design (!MyoAmpF2F4-VGI8)
   * CMRR > 130 dB
   * Gain 71 dB
   * Embedded active ﬁltering:
    * 4th order high-pass ﬁlter at 20 Hz
    * 2nd order low-pass ﬁlter at 400 Hz
    * Notch ﬁlter at 50 Hz. 
   * Galvanic isolation rated to 1,500 Vrms
  * Signals were digitalized at 2 kHz with a 14-bits resolution
