#summary Added support for Delsys Trigno Wireless System under preprocessing.

NOTE: This is an ongoing development and therefore the documentation is not yet finalized.

= Preprocessing =

The figure on the [NTNU] contribution page shows the structure of the preprocessing. However only the first to parts under preprocessing has been modified at [NTNU].

These modifications was made in order to add support for the Delsys Trigno
Wireless System, which is the primary sensor system at [NTNU]. There is now available support for Delsys Trigno Wireless System in [SigRecordings Recordings] and [SigRecordings Recording Session]. 

Delsys Trigno Wireless System is a multimodul unit which is a sensor unit that consists of more then one type of sensors. Under is a description of the sensor system and new sensor data.
