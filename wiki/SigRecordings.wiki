= Recordings =

BioPatRec allows the recording of bio-electric signals through different devices which are already configured (e.g. NI-USB6009), or can be added in [Comm]. 

Recordings can be done as a single time-defined event for fast signal quality evaluation; as a recording session for further processing and PatRec; and as continues recordings for real-time control. There are specific GUIs for each of them. See [BioPatRec_StartupGuide] for quick user instructions and [BioPatRec_Roadmap] for an overview of the functions involved.

A recording session will generate a [recSession] structure, which can be later used for signal treatment (SigTreatment).

= Recording Session =

The recording session is facilitated by a GUI showing the user which motions need to be executed. In "!BioPatRec ETT", this is done by displaying images and a progress bar that decreases according to the time left for either contraction or relaxation. In "!BioPatRec Tv√•", since simultaneous motions were also included, a virtual limb can also be selected to display the requested motions. In "!BioPatRec TRE", it has been added the possibility to do ramp recording sessions.

The following illustration is an example of the recording session GUI in the [http://www.scfbm.org/content/8/1/11 BioPatRec paper] experiment.

== Ramp Recording Session ==
It is a variation of the normal recording session which asks the user to perform the same movements of a classical recording session but using a dynamic effort instead of isometric. During the acquisition, the user is thus invited to follow a guide for the level of effort, starting from a minimum level to reach the maximum strain possible. This guide looks like a ramp, in fact here is the name of the recording session. The system instantaneously calculates the level of effort of the user and displays it on the ramp, giving a feedback to the user by which is possible to manage the correct variation of effort during the recording. In order to calculate the "amount of effort" of the user and to be able to represent it on the guide ramp, the system needs two more recording sessions that must be made necessarily before the main recording. At first, user is asked to remain in a relaxed position, so acquiring the minimum voluntary contraction. After that, the user is asked to do a quick recording session performing all selected movements with maximum effort possible (maximum voluntary contraction). With this data, the system will be able to calculate an instantaneous average effort and represent it by putting it in proportion between the minimum and the maximum effort previously recorded.
