= Recordings =

BioPatRec allows the recording of bio-electric signals through different devices which are already configured (e.g. NI-USB6009), or can be added in [Comm]. 

Recordings can be done as a single time-defined event for fast signal quality evaluation; as a recording session for further processing and PatRec; and as continues recordings for real-time control. There are specific GUIs for each of them. See [BioPatRec_StartupGuide] for quick user instructions and [BioPatRec_Roadmap] for an overview of the functions involved.

A recording session will generate a [recSession] structure, which can be later used for signal treatment (SigTreatment).
