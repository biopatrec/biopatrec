[recSession] -> [sigTreated] -> [sigFeatures] -> [patRec]

= sigFeatures =
 * sF (sampling frequency)
 * tW (time window)
 * nCh (number of channels)
 * mov (movements)
 * dev (device used for recordings)
 * fFilter (frequency filter)
 * sFilter (spatial filter)
 * trSets (training sets, number), see [xSets] 
 * vSets (validation sets, number), see [xSets] 
 * tSets (testing sets, number), see [xSets] 
 * trFeatures (training features), see [xFeatures]

This structure contains the signal features to be used for pattern recognition. These are the training, validation and testing sets (see [xSets]).
