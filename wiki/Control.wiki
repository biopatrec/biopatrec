#summary Control engineering

= Device Control and Control Algorithms =

In the *control* folder routines for device/[VRE] control following the [Movements_Protocol] are provided, as well as control algorithms to be executed during realtime pattern recognition.

= Control algorithms =

The following control algorithms can be selected in the [GUI_TestPatRec_Mov2Mov]

 * Majority vote
 * Buffer output

= How to add a new control algorithm =

To add a control algorithm you have to initialize it in:

 * InitControl

and the add the executing routine in:

 * ApplyControl

These two routines are called in the realtime patrec functions such as:

 * RealtimePatRec
 * MotionTest
 * [TACTest]
