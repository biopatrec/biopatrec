#summary A description about the intent interpretation of the NTNU contribution.

NOTE: This is an ongoing development and therefore the documentation is not yet finalised.

= Intent interpretation =

== Simultaneous proportional control ==
As seen on the front page of the [NTNU] contribution, there is figure showing the details for this part. It is divided into two parts, containing three operations for simultaneous proportional control:
 * [NTNU_Linear_mapping Linear mapping]
 * [NTNU_Nonlinear_flutter_rejection_filter Nonlinear flutter rejection filter]
 * [NTNU_Gain_and_threshold_adjustments Gain and threshold adjustments]

These operations together make the intent interpretation for the simultaneous proportional control.
