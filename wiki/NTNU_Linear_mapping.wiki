#summary The linear mapping function of the simultaneous proportional control

NOTE: This is an ongoing development and therefore the documentation is not yet finalised.

= Linear mapping =

Given a system on the form of formula *[Eq. 1]*, and that there is linear mapping, there are estimators designed to create the relation between the input and output in the system ^[1]^ ^(norwegian source)^.

 F = Ax *[Eq. 1]*

In the formula, x is the input feature vector, A is the matrix mapping x to F, and F is the output vector containing the output intent estimate for the prosthesis control.

Firstly, the algorithm must go through the offline-training in BioPatRec. During the offline-training, the F and x is known from the system training, being in the [xSets xSets] data structure. Thus A can be calculated and used for further estimation.

Lastly, the algorithm is ready to be run through a choice of estimators:
 * Normal linear estimator
 * Decoupled linear estimator
