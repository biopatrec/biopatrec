#summary Summary of important coding changes

= From ETT to TVÅ =

== Additional variable for !OfflinePatRec: algConf ==
Since [SOM] and [SSOM] needed special configurations, the struct variable _algConf_ is now available for transiting configuration parameters. The calling of the following routines was modified to include the _algConf_ variable inmediatly after _tType_.

  * {{{OfflinePatRec}}}
  * {{{OfflinePatRecTraining}}}

In order to use the struct _algConf_, just save it in the [GUI_PatRec] handles. The it will be sent to {{{OfflinePatRec}}} by {{{pb_RunOfflineTraining_Callback}}}. This variable is saved inside patRec.patRecTrained.

== Control algorithms ==

The way the control algorithms are added changed. See: [Control] for details


= From TVÅ to TRE =

== Additional variables for recSession: RampParameters ==
In order to implement the ramp recording session was necessary to add several variables to the recSession structure. For further detail check out the new data structure at [recSession]. 

== Functions for other custom acquisition devices ==
In BioPatRec_TRE are available a new set of functions useful to implement your own custom acquisition device and use it during your PatRec sessions. Check out into the [COMM] section.

== new recording GUI == 
A new GUI is now available for your recording session. To do that, it has been necessary to make several little changes in functions such as DataShow, RecordingSession etc..
