#GUI_SSPresentation is a GUI that can be used to visualize trajectories recorded by [TrackStateSpace] during a [TAC_Test].

= Introduction =

The GUI_SSPresentation is an auxiliary GUI that can be used to visualize  trajectories and targets that has been recorded during a [TAC_Test] experiment.

The GUI was initially designed for a different purpose and is thus not optimal for viewing results from the [TAC_Test].

= Usage =

To open the GUI, write

_GUI_SSPresentation_

in the command line. Load a tacTest file by clicking the folder located in the toolbar. 

The different repetitions are currently available in the Movement-listbox, not in the Repetition-listbox as one might think. Select the desired repetition and view the trajectory.

The target is currently only visualized in the 2D-viewports (as a green circle).

In the _Path Lengths_ panel one can read the [pathEfficiency], _Current_ gives the [pathEfficiency] for current repetition and _Setup_ gives the average [pathEfficiency] for the entire tacTest.
