#summary Startup guide and How To's

= Introduction =

Here we explain how to set up the matlab path

= How To's =

The following are quick guidelines on how to use BioPatRec. In the following instructions it is assumed that you have already setup your workspace and paths in MATLAB to work with BioPatRec.

= How to record signals? =

Signals can be recorded a single shot for fast signal quality evaluations, or as a recording session for further processing and PatRec. In the following steps it is assumed that you have already configured your DAQ card.

== One-shot recordings ==

 * Type !BioPatRec
 * Select "Recordings"
 * ...

== Recording Session ==

 * Type !BioPatRec
 * Select "Recording Session"
 * ...


= How to pre-process the data and extract signal features? =

 * Type !BioPatRec
     * Recordings
     * Recording Session
     * Pattern Recognition
       * Select "Pattern Recognition"
       * Select "Get Signal Features"
       * Lead the file containing the [recSession] structure
       * From Signal Treatment Window, 
         * choose Number of movements,cTp,and Number of channels. 
         * Select "Pre-processing"
         * Select "Filters". Choose type of Filters if required  .
         * Select "Time Window". choose a window method and window length.  
        * Select "Sets per Exercise". Select number of "training", "validation", "test" windows. (Note: The Total Number of windows should be equal to total Number of sets per exercise).
        * Select "Treat".


= How to run offline Pattern Recognition? =

 * Type !BioPatRec
 * Select "Pattern Recognition"
 * Select "Get Signal Features" to load the file with the [sigFeatures] structure. If you only have the [recSession] structure file, see "How to pre-process" before.
 * Select "Feature".
 * Select "Algorithm".
 * Select " Training Method".
 * Select "Normalization".
 * Select "Randomized Set and only indv.Movement" ,if its requried.
 * Select "Topology".
 * Select Run Off-line Training".

= How to run Real-time Pattern Recognition? =

* In order to do this you need to have trained a classifier already in the step before, or have the structure [patRec] avilable. You can load [patRec] from a file using the open menu.
