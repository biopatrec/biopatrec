#summary movMatrix is a matrix that represents the different movements trained in the [PatRec] structure, it is used by the [TrackStateSpace] function.

= Introduction =

The movMatrix is a matrix used by TrackStateSpace to update the internal posture tracker during the [TAC_Test]. This matrix is created when the [TrackStateSpace] function is initialized, and represents the different movements that has been stored in the [PatRec] structure.

= Details =

movMatrix is created with

_movMatrix = !CreateMovMatrix(patRec)_

The movMatrix is a (Nx3)-matrix where N is the number of outputs from the [patRec]-struct that was used to create it.

The rows contains 1 or -1 depending on which direction that the virtual limb is moved in respective DoF.


= Warning = 

The movement matrix [movMat] does currently only handle the movements 

 * Open
 * Close
 * Flex
 * Extend
 * Pronate
 * Supinate

if any other movements are used in the [TAC_Test], or movements are altered using pop-menus in [GUI_TestPatRec_Mov2Mov], the movMatrix will not be created correctly and the tracking will fail.
