#summary BioPatRec features and video demonstrations

= BioPatRec Highlights =

BioPatRec is a modular platform implemented in MATLAB that allows a seamless integration of a variety of algorithms in the fields of 

 # Signal processing
 # Feature selection and extraction
 # Pattern recognition
 # Real-time control

in the context of prosthetic control. 

BioPatRec includes all the necessary routines for prosthetic control based in pattern recognition; from data acquisition to real-time evaluations, including a virtual reality environment and pattern recognition algorithms (see below for all features). 

BioPatRec is demonstrated with the real-time control of a virtual hand and multifunctional prosthetic devices (see the videos below).

=== General features ===
 * *Modular.* As long as the data structures for information transfer are respected, any module could be substituted.
 * *Customizable.* As a result of the modular design, BioPatRec can be adapted to different experimental settings.
 * *User friendly.* The use of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) facilitates BioPatRec utilization. Moreover, a considerable amount of documentation is available in this wiki for its operation.
