#summary Tree-like representation of the most relevant routines

= Introduction =

This is a quick and general overview of the most relevant functions used in BioPatRec. These are functions or GUIs names.

= Recordings (SigRecordings)=

== GUI_Recordings ==

 * pb_StartRecording (Start Recording)
  * DAQShow_SBI

 * pb_ApplyButter (Apply Butter)
  * ApplyButterFilter

 * Menus
  * File
   * Load
    * DataShow or,
    * GUI_RecordingSessionShow
    * Compatibility_recSession (if necessary)
  * Recordings
   * One-shot
    * pb_StartRecording
   * Recording Session
    * GUI_RecordingSession
  * Filters
   * ...
   * ...

== GUI_Recording Session ==

 * pb_Record
  * calls GUI_Recordings 
  * calls GUI_AFEselection 
   * pb_record (GUI_AFEselection)
    * RecordingSession
      * for SBI - NI
       * InitSBI_NI
       * DataShow

== GUI_RecordingSessionShow ==

 * pb_Load
  * DataShow

= Signal Treatment (SigTreatment)=

 * pb_preProcessing (in GUI_SigTreatment, and uses [recSession])
  * Split_recSession_Mov
  * Split_recSession_Ch
  * RemoveTrasient_cTp (returns [sigTreated])
  * AddRestAsMovement (uses [recSession] and complements [sigTreated])

 * pb_treat (in GUI_SigTreatment, and uses [sigTreated])
  * TreatData 
   * ApplyFilters
    * [Filters]
   * GetData (returns sets of raw signal trData, vData and tData)
    * Time window cutting (Non-overlapped, Overlapped cons, etc..)

  * Signal features extraction proceeds (see below)

 * pb_treatFolder
  * Same than pb_treat but for a set of files located in a specific folder. The files must be named: 1, 2, 3,...

= Signal Features (SigFeatures)=

  * GetAllSigFeatures (uses [xData] and returns [sigFeatures])
   * GetSigFeatures
    * Calls every feature computation routines {{{GetSigFeatures_xxx}}}

= Pattern Recognition (PatRec) =

 * OfflinePatRec
  * Rand_sigFeatures
  * GetSets_Stack...
  * Normalize_TrV
  * Creates ([PatRec_Topologies])
  * OfflinePatRecTraining (returns [patRec])
   * xTraining routines (MLP, LDA, etc...)
  * [Accuracy_patRec] (uses [patRec])
   * NormalizeSet
   * OneShotPatRecClassifier
    * Calls ([PatRec_Topologies])
     * OneShotPatRec
      * xTest routines

 * RealtimePatRec (uses [patRec])
  * InitSBI_NI
  * [SignalProcessing_RealtimePatRec]
   * ApplyFilters
   * GetSigFeatures
   * NormalizeSet
  * OneShotPatRecClassifier
    * Calls ([PatRec_Topologies])
     * OneShotPatRec
      * xTest routines
