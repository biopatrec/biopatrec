= Introduction =

Supervised Self-Organizing Map (SSOM) is the supervised version of [SOM]. It is generally known as the supervised learning that takes the class-identity into account in the learning phase. The idea behind SSOM is summarized as that, throughout the learning phase, each output neuron _i_ makes its own prediction _Y(i,M)_  of M movements which represents the percentage of the learning that was gained.   


= Algorithm  ^[1]^=
 Generally, SSOM algorithm has the same network architecture as in [SOM] even the training methods . In order to make SSOM ,the training set (_X_) and weights matrix (_W_) were formed as:
  _*X,,n,d+M,, = [X,,n,d,, , O,,n,M,,]*_.
   _*W,,i,d,M,,=[W,,i,d,, , Y,,i,M,,]*_.

 Where  _X,,n,d,,_  denotes the input training patterns, having _d_ to represent the features per pattern _n_. _O,,n,M,,_ is the label vector (class-identity) which is associated with pattern _n_, consisting of _M_ movements that can take values at 1 or 0 assigned to either one or two movements. The _W,,i,d,,_ is weights vector per neuron _i_ initialized randomly, and _Y,,i,M,,_ is the prediction of neuron _i_ per M movements which is also initialized randomly.      

There are two training methods:
 * Stochastic Training.
 * Batch Training (default).

= Implementation =

* Grid Shape
 * Rectangular Grid (default).
 * Hexagonal Grid.

* Neighbor Function
 * Bubble.
 * Gaussian (default).
 * Cutgaussian.
 * Triangular.
 * Butter worth 2nd order.

* Visualize U-matrix
 * yes.
 * No (default).
