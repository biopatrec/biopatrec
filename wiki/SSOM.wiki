= Introduction =

Supervised Self-Organizing Map (SSOM) is a supervised artificial neural network, this network  has the same model as  [SOM]. The learning in this model is based on  supervised learning i.e. the input-output transformations are adjusted by the system parameters.  


= Algorithm =
 There are two training methods:
 * Stochastic Training.
 * Batch Training.

 == Stochastic Training.==
 The algorithm is summarized as follows:

  # Add the labels in the last columns to the input data.    
  # *Initialization:* Randomly choosing the initial weight vectors  _W,,j,,_ with same dimension of input data. The only restriction is that _W,,j,,_ to be different for _j=1,2,...,n_ where _n_ is the number of neurons in the grid.
  # *Sampling:* Draw randomly the input vector _x_ from the input data sets.
  # * Similarity matching:* Find the best-matching(winning) neuron _i(x)_ at time-step _t_ by using the minimum-euclidean distance criterion where
        _i(x)=arg min || x(t) - W,,j,, | , j=1,2,...,n_
  # *Updating:* Adjust the synaptic-weight vector of all excited neurons by using the update formula *_W,,j,,(t+1)=W,,j,,(t) + eta(t) h,,cj,,(t) ( x(t) - W,,j,,(t) )    ,   j=1,2,...,n_*  where _eta(t)_ is a learning rate parameter and _h,,cj,,(t)_ is the neighborhood function centered around the winning neuron _i(x)_; both _eta(t)_ and _h,,cj,,(t)_are varied dynamically during learning.
  # *Continuation:* Continue  step 3 to 5 for some iterations.

 
 == Batch Training.==
 In the Batch Training the weight vectors for all input data vectors are simultaneously update.

 The algorithm is summarized as follows:
  # Add the labels in the last columns to the input data.
  # Randomly choosing the initial weight vectors  _W,,j,,_ with same    dimension of input data.The only restriction is that _W,,j,,_ to be   different for _j=1,2,...,n_ where _n_ is the number of neurons in the   grid.
  # Find the best-matching(winning) neuron _i(x)_ according to 4 in Stochastic Training.
  # For each wining neuron _j_ calculate _S,,j,,_ is the sum of corresponding input data sets _x,,i,,_ to wining neuron _j_
           _S,,j,,_=sum(_x,,i,,_)   ,_i=1,2......,m_ where _m_ is the number of the input data sets corresponding to wining neuron _j_ and _j=1,2,...,n_ where _n_ is the number of neurons in the grid.
  # For each wining neuron _j_ calculate _A,,j,,_ is the number of input data sets _x,,i,,_ corresponding to that winning neuron _j_
  # _W(t+1)_=( _h,,ij,,(t)_  _S(t)_ ) / (  _A(t)_  _h,,ij,,(t)_ ). where _h,,ij,,(t)_ is a neighborhood function centered around the wining neuron _i_ at time _t_.
  # Continue  step 3 to 6 for some iterations.

 == Classification==

 # Take out the added columns from the weight matrix that represents the output for the neurons. 
 #  Find the best-matching(winning) neuron i(x) according to 4 in Stochastic Training for test set x.
 # The classification of x is the associated output to i(x) .
