= Introduction =

Supervised Self-Organizing Map (SSOM) is a supervised artificial neural network, this network  has the same model as  [SOM]. The learning in this model is based on  supervised learning i.e. the input-output transformations are adjusted by the system parameters.  


= Algorithm  ^[1]^=
 Generally, SSOM algorithm  has the same model as  [SOM] even the training methods . In order to make SSOM  , the input vector is formed into two parts _trSets_ = [_trSets_ , _trOuts_], where _trSets_ is the input features matrix and _trOuts_ is the corresponding labels matrix.      

There are two training methods:
 * Stochastic Training.
 * Batch Training.
see training methods of [SOM]

 

 == Classification==

 # Take out same dimension of _trOuts_ from the weight matrix that represents the output for the neurons. 
 # For test set x, find the best-matching(winning) neuron i(x) according to 4 in Stochastic Training.
 # The classification of x is the associated output to i(x) .
