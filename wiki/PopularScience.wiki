#summary Popular "science" on artificial limbs

= Popular “Science” on Artificial Limbs / Bionic Limbs / Robotic Prostheses =

If you are looking at this page as an introduction to the field, or just for curiosity, please be aware that the content of these articles has not been scientifically reviewed, and therefore any information provided must be taken with caution, and not as the absolute truth. Of course, we cannot generalize completely, as few of them can be rather accurate.

It is probably not a surprise for anybody the fact that the media tend to exaggerate and raise false expectations on what science and technology can currently offer. At the same time, there is no doubt that the amount and quality of the work done by the scientists and engineers featured in these videos deserves recognition and respect. Unfortunately, their work is often misinterpreted by some “journalist” that feel that without exaggerated promises of futuristic achievements, it is not interesting enough to be published. With that being said, it is our responsibility as a community of professionals and scientists to share and comment on these articles, so please feel free to do so!


== Quick and true facts: ==

 * We don’t really have the technology today to fully replace the functionality of a biological limb, thus we are not really close to create a “Robocop”, and definitely there is no need to worry about the threat of “Terminator” anytime soon.

 * The term "bionic" is often misused and therefore now ambiguous. There was a time when it meant an augmentation to the biological capabilities (stronger, faster, more accurate, etc...). Although originally was more on the side of biologically inspired mechatronics. Anyway, the fact is that if we cannot fully replace the biological limbs, we can hardly augmented them, as an exoskeleton would do for instance.

 * The media often use the phrase "mind controlled" or "thought controlled". This is at some extend true, but only because the brain basically controls everything we do! However, this might give the false impression that the prosthesis is controlled by simple "imagining" or "thinking", without any other muscular or physiological response, whereas in reality these signals are often recorded from muscles or the motor cortex rather than in any other area of the brain where "imagination" can take place (e.g. prefrontal cortex).
 
 * Most of the advanced technology presented by the media has only been used in controlled environments (research labs), and is it not really close to be a clinical reality for patients.

 * Lower limb prosthetics currently do a better job restoring functionality than upper limb.

 * We have progressed tremendously on the hardware and software of robotic arms; we are now struggling on how to control them. As today, we CANNOT really do it naturally and intuitively OUTSIDE of controlled environments. We can do it with limited degrees of freedom within the lab and in short periods of time. Sadly, most of the media uses this to insinuate that patients are doing it in their daily activities as well.

 * We have rather advanced prosthetic devices since the last decade, and yet, most of the patients do not use robotic/powered prostheses at all! That is probably the greatest indicator that most of the sophisticated prosthetics we see in the media, can only be used in the lab. 

 * Although the previous points are rather pessimistic, there are a lot of intelligent and dedicated people trying to improve robotic prostheses, so we'll get there!
