#summary Signal treatment and processing

NOTE: we are currently on the documentation process

= Signal Treatment =

The signal treatment module contains routines to:

 * Remove movements and channels which are of no interest (for any reason)
 * Remove transient periods of the contraction (if required)
 * Add the _no movement_ or _rest_ condition as a movement automatically from the recorded session.
 * Apply filters
  * Frequency
   * Power line harmonics
   * Band-pass 20-1k Hz
   * Band-pass 70-1k Hz
  * Spatial (requires specific electrode placement)
   * Single differential (SDF)
   * Double differential (DDF)
   * Absolute double differential (DDF Abs)
 * Window segmentation settings
  * overlap or non-overlap
  * time window length
  * overlap (if required)
  * Number of time windows per set (training, validation and testing)

These functions are easily accessible from the [GUI_SigTreatment] which is loaded by the [Load_patRec] function requiring [recSession]. Once the signal segmentation is accomplished, feature extraction continues [SigFeatures]. Additionally, filters can also be called in the GUI_Recordings for one-shot recordings.

See [BioPatRec_StartupGuide] for quick user instructions and [BioPatRec_Roadmap] for an overview of the functions involved.

Currently, signal treatment and feature extraction are embedded in the same GUI ([GUI_SigTreatment]). However, since an intermediate structure ([sigTreated]) is created before proceeding with [SigFeatures], these two process can be easily split into different GUIs (if required). We haven't seen the need for that though. 

A summary of features can be find in [BioPatRec_Highlights].

Since all the raw data and setting of its acquisition are available in the structure [recSession], additional signal processing can be easily implemented.
