#summary Surface ElectroMyoGraphy

The quality of the recorded myoelectric signals depends strongly on the following:

 * Bio-electrical amplifiers
 * Electrodes and their placements

= Electrode placement for sEMG = 

Recording electrodes:

 * A bipolar configuration is preferable to reduce noise
 * Along the muscle fibers
 * Away from innervation zone if bipolar electrode. No applicable for monopolar
 * Away from the tendon
 * Away from muscle edge

Reference electrode:
 * As far as possible from the recording electrodes
 * Place in an electrically neutral tissue (bony parts)
 * Good electrical contact

NOTE: Do NOT forget to use a reference electrode!!!
