= Introduction =

 k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm (KNN) is a non parametric lazy learning algorithm (there is no explicit training), one of most simple machine learning algorithms. Decision maker in k-NN based on majority voting of its neighbors by using the euclidean distance  as criterion for measuring the distance also k-NN is not based on assumptions of the underlying data distribution but it works to estimate the distribution.     

= Algorithm^[1]^ ==

 In KNN, there is no explicit training. The input of KNN is the training data with its label.
 # Computes the euclidean distance _d(x',x,,j,,)_ between test object _x'_ and the training data _x,,j,,_  _j=1,...,n_ where _n_ is the number of data in training sets.
 # Find the _k-minimum_ distance _d,,k,,_ (nearest vectors).
 # Find the associated label for those nearest vectors.
 # Create the voting by compute the number of nearest vectors from same class.
 # Choosing the winning label which it has highest vote.

   
= Choosing _k_  =
 Choosing _k_ plays a key role on affect the KNN performance where small _k_ can be sensitive to the noisy data and if _k_ is too large the   neighborhood may include too many data from other classes.
 
 Choosing _k_ heuristically using cross validation technique based on evaluating Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of validation data it can be one of best methods to estimate optimal k with lowest RMSE.
