= DAQ Card =

 * The R2011a with data aquisition toolbox 2.18 doesn't support USB devices from NI, only compacDAQ. ([http://www.mathworks.se/matlabcentral/answers/11333-ni-daq-usb-6351-problem-on-win64-platform problem]). This version uses the [http://www.mathworks.se/help/toolbox/daq/bskx95j.html Session-based Interfaces] which doesn't support USB cards, and [http://www.mathworks.se/help/toolbox/daq/ref/analoginput.html legacy] cannot be used in a 64-bit Matlab.

 * In order to use the data aquisition tool box in the R2011b version of MATLAB you have to use [http://www.mathworks.se/help/toolbox/daq/bskx95j.html Session-based Interfaces].

 * Error for USB6009: 

 ''Onboard device memory overflow. Because of system and/or bus-bandwidth limitations, the driver could not read data from the device fast enough to keep up with the device throughput.''

 This error can appear when doing foreground acquisition, see [http://digital.ni.com/public.nsf/allkb/611475F9BE62881E86256FDC0062B1BB USB-6008/6009 Error -200361: Buffer Overflow Error]. It can be solved by unstalling de device from the windows manager device, then disconnect it, wait some minutes and connect it again. It will be automatically installed.

 Note: A [http://www.mathworks.se/matlabcentral/answers/27596-onboard-device-memory-overflow-because-of-system-and-or-bus-bandwidth-limitations-the-driver-could report] has been done to MATLAB about this issue. They recomend to follow a bug patch that can be found in the report. It makes things better since after the patch, unistalling the drivers is not necessary anymore. However, de/conection of the USB cable is still necessary. 

 * The DAQ with the USB6009 is not calling the callback function. This has been solved using the same provedure than the error before.
