#summary Communications (in/out)

= Communications =

All the routines associated with communications can be found in the *Comm* folder. These can be from/to peripherals or other software.

 * Analog Front-End (AFE)
  * Session-Based Interface (SBI)
 * Virtual Reality Environment ([VRE])
 * Artificial Limb Controller ([ALC])

=== Session-Based Interface ===

The SBI routines have been tested for the NI-USB6009, however, many other DAQ cards could be used under this paradigm, see [http://www.mathworks.se/help/toolbox/daq/bskx95j-1.html "About the Session-Based Interface"]. You can use function [TestSBI_NI_USB6009] to test the different acquisition possibilities of SBI. In our experience, the NI-USB6009 is an affordable option for data acquisition.

The SBI can be used for both inputs and outputs, however, we mostly use it for inputs (recordings).

Since BioPatRec was developed before SBI, we also have available the "legacy" routines. See [http://www.mathworks.se/help/toolbox/daq/bsvjl59-1.html Choose the Right Interface] for compatibility.

See [Troubleshooting] for issues.

=== Biopotenial Amplifiers ===

We have developed several low-cost high-CMRR biopotenial amplifiers for our research. We have specific designs for ENG and EMG. If you are looking for bio-amps, we might be able to help you.

== Other peripherals ==

 * AcceleGlove (coming soon...)


= Outputs =

We have established a easy communication protocol to produce physically meaningful outputs (see the Movements_Protocol)

== Virtual Reality Environment ==

In order to easily test and quickly control a prosthesis from the BioPatRec a Virtual Reality Environment ([VRE]) has been developed. Please see relevant page for more information.

== Prosthetic Devices ==

We have developed routines to control prosthetic devices using PWMs or servo motors. The output command is transmitted using the Serial Communication Interface (SCI) to a microcontroller (see the Movements_Protocol).
