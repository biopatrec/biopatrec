#summary The protocol used to control the Virtual Reality Environment.

= Introduction =
The idea behind the protocol is to have an easy system that can be easily implemented onto any existing system and is very close to that which is implemented on the hardware version.

To limit the amount of data being sent each time, each DoF is handled separately, thus needing one transfer for each movement being made.

== Protocol ==
The protocol consists of four bytes being transferred each time. The different setups are shown, and explained, in the table below:

||{{{[Byte]}}} - Operation||Value #1||Value #2||Value #3||
||{{{[1]}}} - Movement of hand||Indicating which DoF||Indicating which direction to move||Indicating distance to move in given direction||
||{{{[2]}}} - Movement of TAC||Indicating which DoF||Indicating which direction to move||Indicating distance to move in given direction||
||{{{[c]}}} - Configuration||See below||for more||information.||
||{{{[r]}}} - Reset position||If set to {{{[t]}}}, resets position of TAC. Otherwise the normal hand.||Not specified.||Not specified.||

An example of the protocol is given:
{{{
'1215' - The normal hands 2nd DoF is extended 5 steps.
'2303' - The TAC hands 3rd DoF is flexed 3 steps.
'rt00' - The position of the TAC hand is reset.
}}}

== Configurations ==

If anything needs to be configured in the Virtual Reality Environment, a configuration parameter can be sent in order to change vital parameters without editing the code.

Below are all the codes with a short explanation of how to use it.

In order to edit any information you must first send **c** as the Operation Byte. (see above) Once that is set the three possible values can be used, as shown in the table below, to edit the values of the VRE.

||Value #1||Value #2||Value #3||Description||
||1||relativeDistance||(not used)||Changing this will change the distance each movement step will move.||
||2||Perform TAC||1/0||Set the value #3 to 1/0 depending on if you want to perform the TAC test.||
||3||Allowance||(not used)||Set the allowed distance that the user can be from the TAC test in order for it to still be classified as completed.||
||4||Camera||(not used)||Set which camera to look through.|| 

== DoF Map ==

Information regarding which DoF corresponds to which movements can be found in the table below.

||DoF||Movement||
||1||Pinky - Pitch||
||2||Ring - Pitch||
||3||Long - Pitch||
||4||Index - Pitch||
||5||Thumb - Pitch||
||6||Thumb - Yaw||
||7||Palm - Pitch||
||8||Palm - Roll||
||9||Open/Close Hand||
