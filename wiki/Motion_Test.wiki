#summary Description of the Motion test

= Introduction =

The Motion Test was originally introduced by Kuiken _et al._ (2009) as one of the first real-time evaluations of pattern recognition applied in prosthetic control. For a comprehensive explanation and rationale of this test, see:

[http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=183371 Kuiken TA, Lock BA, Lipschutz RDR, Miller LA, Stubbleﬁeld KAK, Englehart KBK, Li G: Targeted muscle reinnervation for real-time myoelectric control of multifunction artiﬁcial arms. JAMA: the journal of the American Medical Association 2009, 301(6):619–628.]

A real-time evaluation for controlability would by the [TAC_Test TAC test].

= Implementation in !BioPatRec = 

Although the implementation of this test in !BioPatRec is based in the latter publication. It has some modifications. 

 * *Selection time.* Time to the first correct prediction ... description ...
 * *Completion time.* Requires the prediction of 20 correct movements ... description ...
 * *Completion rate.* Number of motions that achieved a completion.

Additional:

 * *Real-time accuracy.* Classifier accuracy during the completion time
  * The real-time accuracy is only assigned to completed motions.

== Requirements ==

 * [patRec] - a trained classifier is required, see PatRec.
 * Data acquisition is required, see [Communications]

= NOTES: =

 * The motion test assumes that there is always a _rest_ or _no movement_ class.
