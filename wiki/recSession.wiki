#summary recSession description

[recSession] -> [sigTreated] -> [sigFeatures] -> [patRec]

= recSession =
 * sF (sampling frequency)
 * sT (sampling time)
 * cT (contraction time)
 * rT (relaxation time)
 * nM (number of movements)
 * nR (number of repetitions)
 * nCh (number of channels)
 * dev (device used for the recordings)
 * comm (communication mode, Wifi or COM)
  * comn (COM name, available only in case of COM communication) 
 * mov (description of the movements performed)
 * date
 * cmt (comments)
 * tdata (total data, Samples x Channels x Movements)
 * RampParameters (available only in case of ramp recording session)
  * rampMin (RMS mean value between all channels of the Minimum Voluntary Contraction session) 
  * rampMax (RMS mean value between all channels of the Maximum Voluntary Contraction session, RMSmean x Movements)
  * minData (data of the Minimum Voluntary Contraction session, Samples x Channels)
  * maxData (data of the Maximum Voluntary Contraction session, Samples x Channels x Movements)

Previously due to the heritage of the [EMG_AQ] the following fields were included

 * cTp (contraction time percentage)
 * trdata(data extracted using the cTp)

These two fields are no longer in the [recSession] and became part of [sigTreated].
