#summary recSession description

recSession will become [sigTreated]

= recSession =
 * sF (sampling frequency)
 * sT (sampling time)
 * cT (contraction time)
 * rT (relaxation time)
 * nM (number of movements)
 * nR (number of repetitions)
 * dev (device used for the recordings)
 * nCh (number of channels)
 * mov (description of the movements performed)
 * date
 * cmt (comments)
 * tdata (total data) 

Previously due to the heritage of the [EMG_AQ] the following fields were included

 * cTp (contration time percentage)
 * trdata( data extracted using the cTp)

These two fields were removed from the recSession and now are part of [sigTreated].
