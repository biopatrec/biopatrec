#summary patRec description

[recSession] -> [sigTreated] -> [sigFeatures] -> [patRec]

= patRec =
 * nM (number of movements)
 * mov (movements)
 * sF (sampling frequency)
 * tW (time window)
 * nCh (vector with the number of channels)
 * dev (device used for recordings)
 * fFilter (frequency filter)
 * sFilter (spatial filter)
 * selFeatures (selected features ID, cell) 
 * topology
 * movOutIdx (index for the movements related to the output 
 * normSets (normalization information, struct)
 * patRecTrained
 * acc (accuracy per movement plus the over all accuracy in the last row) 
 * date

According to the algorithm used (see [PatRec_Algorithms], additional variables in patRecTrained contain the required information (training) for applying the trained classifier.
