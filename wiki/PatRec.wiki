Different pattern recognition (PatRec) funtions can be accessed by the GUI for PatRec (GUI_PatRec). For a general overview of the routines involved in PatRec see BioPatRec_Roadmap

 * Get the signal features [sigFeatures] by:
      *   Load_[recSession] or
      *   Load_[sigFeatures] 

 * Offline PatRec
        *  Calls [OfflinePatRec] and uses [sigFeatures] and others
        *  First the training and validation sets are extracted (see The [training], [testing] and validation sets?)
        *  Then the classifier topology is created (see PatRec [Topologies]).
        *  Finally [OfflinePatRec] calls [OfflinePatRecTraining] to proceed with the classifier(s) training.
        *  Returns the patRec containing all information required for testing the classifier(s). 

 * Real-time PatRec

        *  The 'Real-time PatRec' botton will take you to the a dedicated GUI Test PatRec using:
        *  Load_patRec? to the GUI_TestPatRec?.
