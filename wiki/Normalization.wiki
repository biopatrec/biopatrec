#summary Normalization

= Normalization =

The choice of the normalization method depends strongly on the implementation of a given algorithm, and it can greatly affects the classifier performance.

Normalization is usually required to avoid that features with large magnitudes eclipse the contribution of the rest.

== Normalization methods ==
 * Statistical normalization (Mean 0, Variance 1)
 * Unitary range (0 to 1), preferred in:
  * [RFN]
 * Mid-range 0, Range 2 (-1 to 1), preferred in:
   * [MLP]


= How to add a normalization method? =

 * Add the processing function in [NormalizeSets_TrV]. The parameters required to normalize future data sets must be included in the struct _normSets_. This function must normalize the training and validation sets independently. See the other normalization function as example.

 * Add the normalization fuction to _NormalizeSet_. This function must normalize a single vector using the provided parameters.
